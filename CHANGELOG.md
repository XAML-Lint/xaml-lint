## [Unreleased]

### Added

- [LX702](docs/rules/LX702.md) — TextBox lacks accessibility description. Covers WPF, WinUI 3, UWP, Avalonia, and Uno (MAUI is covered by LX703). Port of upstream RXT601. Off by default in `:recommended`.
- [LX703](docs/rules/LX703.md) — Entry lacks accessibility description. MAUI-original sibling to LX702. Off by default in `:recommended`.
- [LX800](docs/rules/LX800.md) — Uno platform XML namespace must be `mc:Ignorable`. Port of upstream RXT700; opens the Platform category (LX800–LX899). On in `:recommended` at `warning`.
- Scope-aware `XamlNameIndex` infrastructure backing `{x:Reference}` validation. Templates (`ControlTemplate`/`DataTemplate`/`ItemsPanelTemplate`/`HierarchicalDataTemplate`) isolate names from the outer scope — cross-template references are rejected, matching XAML runtime semantics.

### Changed

- [LX700](docs/rules/LX700.md) and [LX701](docs/rules/LX701.md) — `AutomationProperties.LabeledBy="{x:Reference <name>}"` now suppresses the rule only when the referenced name is declared in the same XAML name scope as the image. Dangling references (typo'd targets, deleted elements, cross-template references) now fire. Behaviour is unchanged for non-reference literals and for `{Binding …}` / other markup extensions.
- [LX700](docs/rules/LX700.md), [LX701](docs/rules/LX701.md), and [LX702](docs/rules/LX702.md) — `AutomationProperties.LabeledBy="{Binding ElementName=<name>}"` is now recognised as an element reference on the same footing as `{x:Reference}` and scope-validated the same way. The `{Binding ElementName=…}` form is the dominant WPF element-reference idiom (predates `x:Reference`) and was previously swept under the permissive "any other markup extension suppresses" branch — dangling `ElementName` targets wrongly suppressed. `{Binding Path=…}` without `ElementName` still suppresses permissively since it can't be statically resolved to an element.
- [LX702](docs/rules/LX702.md) — reverse-direction WPF labeling via `<Label Target="{x:Reference <name>}">` or `<Label Target="{Binding ElementName=<name>}">` now suppresses the diagnostic on the referenced `TextBox`. Matches the XAML runtime semantics where `Label.Target` wires the automation peer so screen readers announce the Label's content as the input's name. Scope isolation applies: a `Label` inside a `ControlTemplate` / `DataTemplate` only suppresses TextBoxes declared in the same template scope.

### Fixed

- [LX700](docs/rules/LX700.md) and [LX701](docs/rules/LX701.md) — MAUI's `SemanticProperties.Description` and `SemanticProperties.Hint` now suppress the rule. The idiomatic MAUI accessibility markup was previously flagged as missing even though `SemanticProperties.*` is the canonical way to attach an AT name/hint on MAUI. Matches LX703's existing behaviour.
- [LX301](docs/rules/LX301.md) — no longer false-positives on UWP/WinUI `x:Uid` values in the `/ResourceFile/Key` resw namespace-scope form. The casing convention now applies to the resource key (the segment after the final `/`) instead of the leading `/` character; `x:Uid="/resources/Description"` is compliant, `x:Uid="/resources/description"` still fires.
- Avalonia `.axaml` files are now linted as first-class XAML. Previously every `.axaml` path emitted [LX005](docs/rules/LX005.md) ("Skipping non-XAML file") and the rule pipeline never ran against it — even under `--force`. Both the CLI (positional paths, directory recursion) and the Claude Code hook now accept `.axaml` alongside `.xaml`.
- [LX400](docs/rules/LX400.md) — values whose non-whitespace characters contain no letters and no digits are now treated as non-localisable chrome and skipped. Covers both icon-font glyphs in the Unicode Private Use Area (Segoe MDL2 Assets, Segoe Fluent Icons, Material Icons, FontAwesome, and similar) and UI-chrome punctuation like `"+"`, `"-"`, `":"`, `"&lt;&lt;"`. Single letters (`"X"`), digits (`"1"` localises to `"١"` in Arabic), and mixed values (`"+ Add"`) still fire.
- `xaml-lint hook` no longer emits an `LX005` diagnostic for every non-XAML file Claude edits. The hook now short-circuits on any `tool_input.file_path` that doesn't end in `.xaml` (case-insensitive) before config discovery or the rule catalog load, writing an empty envelope to stdout. The `lint` subcommand's LX005 behavior is unchanged.
- Hook empty-envelope response now reports the actual tool version instead of a hardcoded `"dev"` literal. Both empty-payload and non-XAML code paths go through `CompactJsonFormatter`, so the shape matches every other hook response.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-19

Stable release. No behavior changes since v0.5.0 beyond the `main`-branch polish below. Starting here, `version.json` carries the full 3-segment version verbatim (no prerelease suffix, no git-height-as-patch) — published package version matches the git tag exactly.

### Added

- `DefaultEnabled` property on `XamlRuleAttribute` (defaults `true`). Rules marked `DefaultEnabled = false` are written as `"off"` in the `xaml-lint:recommended` preset — useful for signals that are valuable but too noisy for most projects out-of-the-box. `:strict` still enables them at the escalated severity, and users extending `:recommended` can opt in explicitly.

### Changed

- Multi-target `net8.0;net9.0;net10.0` for the shipped CLI tool and `XamlLint.Core` library. Previously `net10.0`-only, which required users to have the .NET 10 runtime installed to run the tool; now matches prevailing dotnet-tool practice (csharpier, dotnet-ef, reportgenerator, NSwag, etc. all multi-target the same set). The source generator stays `netstandard2.0`; the internal `DocTool` stays `net10.0` (it only runs in CI via `dotnet run`, which picks the highest-compatible TFM anyway).
- `xaml-lint:recommended` preset tuned based on dogfooding against a real ~1k-file WPF codebase — two rules are now off-by-default (`DefaultEnabled = false`) because they dominated output noise without catching real bugs:
  - [LX400](docs/rules/LX400.md) (hardcoded string → resource): `info` → `off`. Localization is opt-in; most apps aren't fully localized.
  - [LX300](docs/rules/LX300.md) (x:Name should start with uppercase): `warning` → `off`. Lowercase `x:Name` is common for template-internal or pure-layout names (`border`, `grid`, `PART_ContentHost`); style consistency is a team preference.
  - Both rules retain their original `DefaultSeverity` and still fire in `:strict` (LX400 `warning`, LX300 `error`); users who want them on in `:recommended` can enable them explicitly.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-19

M5 — pre-v1 polish. Rules-inert release focused on org migration, repo hygiene, release-surface polish, and contributor docs.

- `$id` / `$schema` URLs in `schema/v1/config.json`, the three bundled presets, `README.md`, and `docs/config-reference.md` now point at the new owner. URL shape preserved on `raw.githubusercontent.com` ([#6])
- Repo-metadata owner refs updated: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` homepage, `Directory.Build.props` (`PackageProjectUrl` + `RepositoryUrl`), `CHANGELOG.md` compare/PR links, SARIF output `informationUri`, `docs/rules/LX006.md` issue-tracker link ([#6])
